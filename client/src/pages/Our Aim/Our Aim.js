        <h4> "Literature claims that value based stories are an extremely useful tool in character education because stories form mental images in children's minds. Children learn much better from pictures than from  precepts; they  learn much  better from  examples than from teachings. Therefore,  stories help  transmit proper  values. Moral stories create opportunities for children to learn meaningful lessons as well as in achieving broader learning, where they can show compassion and empathy to one another  and    at  the  same  time    be  part  of  a  community,    creating    positive  change .  It  is  clear  that  the  narration  of  moral  stories  is  an effective  approach  to  inculcate  values  among  children.  Therefore,  mothers and teachers  should intentionally address childrenâ€˜s development the moral aspect  Learning Values through Moral Stories."</h4>
